# dandis_iana_info2
progetto info 2 per la prova di 12 febbraio 2021

For a university exam, I developed an application in Java that manages a set of video game challenges. The application is able to read information from an external text file and manage different schedules for scheduling challenges for competitors, with the ability to add or remove users or new challenges, and manage possible system errors.
